make -C build tsvitch -j$(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)
```

</details>

### Cross-compile the Switch executable (tsvitch.nro)

Recommended to use docker build, local build configuration environment is slightly cumbersome, but can be used to switch the underlying ffmpeg or mpv and other dependent libraries for more flexible debugging.

<details>

The following describes the build method under OpenGL. deko3d (better hard solver support) please refer to it: `scripts/build_switch_deko3d.sh`

#### Docker

```shell
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/data devkitpro/devkita64:20240202 \
  bash -c "/data/scripts/build_switch.sh"
```

#### 本地编译

```shell
# 1. Install the devkitpro environment: https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman/releases

# 2. Installation of dependencies
sudo dkp-pacman -S switch-glfw switch-libwebp switch-cmake switch-curl devkitA64

# 3. Installing custom dependencies
base_url="https://github.com/xfangfang/wilwili/releases/download/v0.1.0"
sudo dkp-pacman -U \
    $base_url/switch-ffmpeg-7.1-1-any.pkg.tar.zst \
    $base_url/switch-libmpv-0.36.0-3-any.pkg.tar.zst
